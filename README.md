Play the adventure game Zork

## About 
Zork is one of the classic text based adventure games from an era before high-end graphics circuits, instead it runs on the graphics hardware of your mind!

Explore the white house, the forest surrounding it and the hidden kingdom below it. 
Moving this from the text domain to the voice domain makes for a curiously engaging experience and if nothing else a fun couple of minutes.

The skill utilizes the excellent Frotz (http://frotz.sourceforge.net/) Z-Machine interpreter and the Zork data files are from infocom-if (http://infocom-if.org/index2.html).

*Be ware of Grues....*

## Examples 
* "play zork"
* "Go to the white house"
* "quit zork"
* "open mailbox"

## License and Source code

The source code for starcross can be found [here](https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1).  It is not considered to be under an open license.

As far as I know, Activision have still not declared the games abandonware. 

But I do not believe that it is in the spirit of copyright law that works of art drift into oblivion by unavailability. 
 
The day the games are republished in their old glory, I will gladly remove the files from this repository. Until then, I hope they will be allowed to remain here so you can have fun playing them in a novel way.
